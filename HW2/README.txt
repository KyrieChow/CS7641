1. I have used Jupyter notebook in the assignment. You can download the code from
https://github.gatech.edu/zzhou483/CS7641/tree/main/HW2
https://github.com/KyrieChow/CS7641

2. You may need to install all requirements as specified in requirements.txt
3. All datasets are attached. You will need to put the datasets under the same folder as the notebook, or you can specify your own data path in the notebook.
4. I put each problem for one notebook. Just run all the cells in the notebook :)
